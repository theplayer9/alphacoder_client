## üí• Introduction

In the current scenario, every tech enthusiast irrespective of their field of expertise must have a strong knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms. To address the problem we have come up with an idea to develop an application(AlphaCoder) where all the top-notch resources are accumulated at a single platform so that a student doesn't have to Rome on the internet from one platform to another. AlphaCoder provides all the top DSA sheets that we have on the internet and also the most frequently asked interview question on a single platform. Moreover, to make learning more fun and interactive we are planning to build a "1 on 1 battle" where 2 students can come to a room and compete with each other. We will also make sure that no code copy or any bad practice takes place in this application.

## üí° Why did I build this?

The idea for this project was one of those startup ideas that I had a couple of months ago. When I landed in college in 2020, I and my friends were exploring various edtech platforms for the study purpose. We foung many such platforms and many creators creating their content, which at some point creats confusion for a student. That's when I decided to make a AlphaCoder which will do all the heavy lifting for us and will accumulate all the top quality content at a single platform.

It is built using **React JS**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS** with full responsive functionality. I have used _Context API_ to manage the state of our app. We have used **Go** and **Fibre** to create auth and routes for various needs and to used **MongoDB** build a stable backend and store data.
